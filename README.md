# Basic coding etiquette / tips

- Please comment your code extensively but yet concise, especially when making new variables where abbreviations are used. 
- Use doc string when creating functions or classes so the reader know what to expect from the function
- Branching is an excellent way to work in parrallel

I think those are the most important ones, feel free to add some rules and tips! And of course have fun!
